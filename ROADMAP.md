- [ ] P2 Persistent gateway + Desktop connection
- [ ] P3 Hafiye Composer + tray + autostart
- [ ] P4 llama.cpp managed local runtime
- [ ] P5 Providers + Gemini + remote OpenAI-compatible
- [ ] P6 Model router + privacy modes
- [ ] P7 Full host tools + execution policy
- [ ] P8 Hafiye root broker
- [ ] P9 Linux computer use
- [ ] P10 Browser
- [ ] P11 Local Turkish voice stack
- [ ] P12 Custom Hafiye wake word
- [ ] P13 Barge-in + emergency stop
- [ ] P14 Memory + project registry
- [ ] P15 OpenHands coding delegate
- [ ] P16 Task Center
- [ ] P17 Control Center
- [ ] P18 Scheduler / skills / MCP
- [ ] P19 Hardening
- [ ] P20 Packaging
- [ ] P21 First-run onboarding
- [ ] P22 CLI
- [ ] P23 Final E2E suite

## P0 execution status

- [x] Preserve upstream Git history and establish the Hafiye development branch.
- [x] Configure origin and upstream.
- [x] Record the pinned Hermes commit in UPSTREAM.md.
- [x] Inspect and record the real Ubuntu/Linux environment.
- [x] Install the user-space Python toolchain needed by the upstream constraints.
- [x] Run the unmodified upstream backend test suite and the optional-SDK run.
- [x] Build and test the unmodified Hermes Desktop baseline.
- [x] Run the historical and pinned-source computer-use-linux diagnostics.
- [x] Complete the pinned-source official setup and pass final doctor readiness.
- [x] Classify the exact upstream baseline failures under
      ACCEPTED_UPSTREAM_BASELINE.

P0 is complete. The original five-failure baseline was reduced to four current
accepted failures after Hafiye source changes; the browser-control baseline
failure now passes. The accepted failures, missing pactl, and missing
vulkaninfo are documented warnings/diagnostics and are not P0 blockers.

## P1 execution status

- [x] Rebrand normal user-facing CLI and Desktop surfaces to Hafiye.
- [x] Add the Hafiye CLI alias while retaining Hermes launcher compatibility.
- [x] Rebrand Desktop title, menus, Quick Entry, onboarding, notifications,
      update/bootstrap text, app identifiers, and default assets.
- [x] Keep upstream internal module names, IPC keys, compatibility environment
      names, legacy protocol scheme, and legal/upstream attribution intact.
- [x] Implement the four Hafiye XDG roots:
      config, data, state, and cache.
- [x] Keep explicit HERMES_HOME and profile/context overrides compatible with
      the upstream single-root behavior.
- [x] Add and test a conservative, non-destructive legacy Hermes-home
      migration command.
- [x] Add neutral H monogram assets and use them in Desktop packaging.
- [x] Make Python and Desktop path resolution agree on POSIX and Windows.
- [x] Run targeted tests, the full Desktop suite, typecheck, production build,
      Linux unpacked packaging, lint, and real temporary-root CLI smoke tests.

P1 is complete. Its source implementation is recorded in commit
34f1d8c2472e6b70b71bbdbfc9d3292761dbb67b. The P1 exit condition is satisfied:
normal Hafiye use has no user-facing Hermes branding except legal/upstream
attribution and retained compatibility machinery. The next incomplete phase is
P2 — Persistent gateway + Desktop connection.
